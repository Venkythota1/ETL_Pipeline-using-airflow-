# ETL_Pipeline-using-airflow
Data Pipeline Using Airflow to Pull Amazon Data Engineering Books and Store in PostgreSQL


**🧩 Overview**

This project demonstrates how to build a data pipeline using Apache Airflow to scrape Amazon Data Engineering books and store the results in a PostgreSQL database.

All components are open-source and run locally using Docker containers.

**⚙️ Architecture**

**Tools Used:**

Apache Airflow → Workflow orchestration tool (scheduler)

PostgreSQL → Relational database for storing data

pgAdmin → GUI for managing PostgreSQL

Docker Compose → To manage and run all containers together


Code to add in docker compose yaml file below services

"""

postgres:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: airflow
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: airflow
      POSTGRES_DB: airflow

**
🧠 Airflow Components**
Component	Description
Scheduler	:Schedules and triggers the execution of DAGs
Webserver :	Runs the Airflow UI for monitoring DAGs
Metadata DB	Stores DAG runs, task status, and configuration data
Executor :	Executes the tasks defined in the DAG

A DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) represents a workflow — a collection of tasks executed in a specific order.

🐳 Setup: Airflow on Docker

We use Docker Compose to run Airflow, PostgreSQL, and pgAdmin containers together.
**
🔗 Reference**

Official Airflow on Docker Documentation

**🧾 Steps**

Install Airflow on Docker

docker compose up airflow-init
docker compose up


Install PostgreSQL and pgAdmin on Docker
Both are included in the same docker-compose.yml file or can be added as separate services.

Verify Running Containers

docker ps
docker container ls


Inspect PostgreSQL Container
To connect from pgAdmin or Airflow:

docker inspect <container_id>


Copy the IP Address of the PostgreSQL container.

Connect pgAdmin to PostgreSQL
Use the container IP and port from the inspect command.

Create Database
In pgAdmin, create a new database named:

amazon_books

📄 DAG Description

The Airflow DAG performs the following tasks:

Extract

Scrapes book data (title, author, price, and rating) from Amazon.

Fetches top Data Engineering books.

Transform

Removes duplicates.

Cleans and formats the data into a Pandas DataFrame.

Load

Uses PostgresHook to connect to PostgreSQL.

Inserts the data into the books table.

**🧠 Workflow Summary**
Step	Task	Description
1	scrape_books	Scrape book data from Amazon
2	clean_books	Clean and deduplicate data
3	load_to_postgres	Insert cleaned data into PostgreSQL using PostgresHook
🗄️ Example Table Schema (books)
Column	Type	Description
title	TEXT	Book title
author	TEXT	Book author
price	FLOAT	Price of the book
rating	FLOAT	Average rating
🧰 Airflow Connection Setup



**In the Airflow UI:**

Navigate to Admin → Connections → +

Create a new connection:

Conn Id: postgres_conn

Conn Type: Postgres

Host: <PostgreSQL container IP>

Schema: amazon_books

Login: postgres

Password: <your_password>

Port: 5432
